# Test-Exercise

In order to be able to run the test you need to use command "npm install" to get all the dependencies installed.
After that you can use command "npm test" to run the tests.

Important to mention:
	1. I couldn't not create an account without an activation code (pic. Message for no code)
        2. There was no functionaloty to test for account view (pic. Account view)
	3. There are 5 Profile files, that is because the test were messing with each other. Tried to find a niccer solution, but after 30
	minutes I decided that this one is good enough, even though is not elegant.
	4. Profile 5 test which is failing is correct, it has a comment why (pic. Error new mail)
	5. Points to improve:
		a. If I would have been part of a development team I would have asked a developer to help me find a solution for the 
		registration codes (like DB). I was thinking at one point to use a csv to write the good codes in one column and the bad in
		another, but that would have taken some time and maybe not the best solution.
		b. Find a solution to use global variables in some places.
		C. Find a better solution for using actions with selectors.
